<h3>About ANrena:</h3><p>ANrena is a website created with the intention of creating a much more convenient, fast, and easy way for people to draft Netrunner online.
It is modeled off of the "Arena" mode in Hearthstone, in which you choose a class (here, it's your Identity) and make a deck out of several randomly selected card
choices.</p>
